This site is a collection of different articles about Vue, Django, and how they connect and interact.  It's created in the style of a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, where, if you are already comfortable with a topic, you can skip to the article that uses that topic under the assumption that you already know it.  If you want to have some of the more basic questions answered, it'll send you off on a tangent to fill in those fundamentals before coming back to the main flow.

Currently, the idea is that we'll build an app together that uses both Vue and Django to various degrees.  It'll be a sort of adventure game (an extension of the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure theme), but that could change as we explore more and more topics.

My name is Ryan Palo.  I usually write at [`assert_not magic?`](https://assertnotmagic.com), my personal blog.  I'm a mechanical engineer in the SF Bay Area and a programmer by hobby.  Check out my [about page](https://assertnotmagic.com/about/) for more links and ways to get in touch.

I'm also using this project as a way to really learn Vue, Django, and fill in my understanding of JavaScript, Python, the web, and the tools and ecosystems surrounding them all.  Keep this in mind as you read through these articles, and if you see something I missed, spot an error, or have a better, more idiomatic way to do something, let me know!  I'll publicly praise your genius put a thank you in the articles.  I'm always happy to learn something new that I can help teach to more people.

Likewise, I want to hear about it if you've got an idea for an article I could do, an idea for the site, or just have some questions about the content.  This whole site's source is [open on Github](https://github.com/rpalo/vue-on-django-site), so the best way is probably to open an issue (or a pull request!) and get involved.  Thanks for reading and happy coding!

Ryan
